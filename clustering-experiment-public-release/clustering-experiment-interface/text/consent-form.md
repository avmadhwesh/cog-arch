## Consent Form | Spatial Math Study 1

You are invited to participate in a research study of how people solve
clustering problems. You were selected as a possible participant because
you are an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota and you
are between 18-24 years of age. We ask that you read this form and ask
any questions you may have before agreeing to be in the study.

This study is being conducted by Vijay Marupudi, Vimal Rao, Rina Harsch,
and Jimin Park (graduate students, Educational Psychology Department);
Dr. Jeffrey Bye (lecturer, Educational Psychology Department), and
Dr. Sashank Varma (professor, Educational Psychology Department).

Background Information
----------------------

The purpose of this study is to investigate how people solve clustering
problems.

Procedures
----------

If you agree to be in this study, we would ask you to complete two
computerized tasks: (1) a clustering task and (2) an arithmetic
estimation task.

In the clustering task, you will view a sequence of images, each
containing fewer than 50 dots. You will use the mouse to draw circles
around those dots that you judge to form clusters. In the arithmetic
estimation task, you will view a sequence of arithmetic expression such
as 6 x 6 x 6 x 6 x 6 x 6. You will be given 5 seconds to estimate the
result of evaluating the expression.

Each task will begin with a few practice trials to familiarize you with
how the stimuli will be presented and how you should respond. You will
be allowed to take short breaks between tasks. The clustering task is
relatively easy, and there is no "right" answer. The arithmetic
estimation task is more difficult because of the large sizes of the
problems and the limited time to answer each one, but again we are
interested in your best estimate for each problem; no one will be able
to compute an exact answer in 5 seconds.

The study will take approximately 50-60 minutes to complete.

Risks and Benefits of being in the Study
----------------------------------------

The study has no known risks.

There are no expected benefits to participating in this study.

Compensation:
-------------

You will receive payment in the form of \$12 for participating in this
study. Your participation is entirely voluntary. You are free to
withdraw at any time, and if you do, you will receive partial payment in
the form of \$4.

Confidentiality
---------------

The records of this study will be kept private. In any sort of report we
might publish, we will not include any information that will make it
possible to identify a subject. Research records will be stored securely
and only researchers will have access to the records.

Voluntary Nature of the Study
-----------------------------

Participation in this study is voluntary. Your decision whether or not
to participate will not affect your current or future relations with the
University of Minnesota. If you decide to participate, you are free to
not answer any question or withdraw at any time without affecting those
relationships.
