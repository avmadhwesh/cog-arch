# Instructions

You will see some points displayed on the screen each trial. You task will be to draw circles around clusters of points. You can draw as many circles as you see fit. However, you will need to draw more than one circle per trial. The trial will end when you have drawn circles around all the dots.

You will draw the circles using your mouse. Click at the point you want to start drawing and trace the shape around the points you want to cluster. Release your mouse after you are done to complete the rest of the shape. You can drag beyond the rectangle where the points are displayed, so do not feel constrained by the borders.

Click next to continue to practice trials.
