# README

* First, build the Python C extension, used to generate random points really fast
* Make sure you have `cairo` and `pycairo` installed to visualize the points (if you don't care, delete the relevant part of the script)
* Run `stimuli_maker.py`
* The build folder will now include the stimulus files
